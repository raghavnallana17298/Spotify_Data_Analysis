# Spotify_Data_Analysis
I have taken the datasets On Spotify playlist from the Kaggle website. During the analysis phase I tried to draw the conclusion on 4 major things.
1) Top five artists on Spotify with popular songs.
2) Songs crossing three billion streams.
3) Number of popular songs released each year(2019-2023)
4) Songs with high energy and danceability

This is what the conclusion I have made through data visualisation which is done on tableau.
